Guide to CUFE CHS life:   
   
Hello and welcome to CUFE CHS, it might be heaven (uh not really for me, but who knows), it might be hell, it might be just in-between like everything else.   
   
It is ok to feel a bit lost at first, hopefully this can help you.

# Myths (all untrue) `{_obsidian_pattern_tag_Myths}`   
   
   
- Credit is easier than mainstream.   
   
   
- Credit students are richer (this is more of a stereotype, it is actually half false).   
   
   
- Credit have better lecture halls (half false as well).   
   
# Paths   
   
There are multiple paths you can choose in uni, each with their ups and downs.   
   
* Supreme Nerd.   
   
* Normal Normie.   
   
* Slacker Procrastinator.   
   
But you need to remember that even a slacker can beat a super nerd, but that is not always the case, just don't be depressed because you are not a supreme nerd, try to improve what you can instead.   
   
### Supreme Nerd   
   
Being a nerd doesn't mean you cannot have friends, even nerds have friends. You might even get more friends because they want your help in assignments and be on your team in projects. Just try to have more than one nerd as a friend though, and pick good people as friends.   
   
### Normal Normie   
   
Normal people. Studies when necessary and tries to have a balance between fun and studying.   
   
### Slacker Procrastinator   
   
I am too lazy to describe them, remind me tomorrow.   
   
Now, jokes are over. Time to get into the details.   
   
Lectures, tutorials, assignments, projects, deadlines, representatives, announcements, and probably some other things I forgot. You get used to it in time, but the sooner you understand your new life, the better.   
   
# Attendance `{_obsidian_pattern_tag_Important}`    
   
You must not be absent for more than **25% of lectures and tutorials, measured by their length in hours (not credit hours)**, otherwise you will be deprived/disallowed from sitting the final exam and get a FW (forced withdraw) in this course. [The attendance tool](https://chs-absence.vercel.app/) can help you determine how many times you can be absence. If you were absent for a medical reason and got deprived, you can present your excuse with official papers to the professor, and ask the professor if they will agree to allow you to attend the final exam. Do note this might not work with all professors, the professor normally has the right to refuse to deprive you, but it is up to the professor.   
**In no way can you remove the absence records for any reason, excuse or no excuse. Any official excuse (from the Cairo University Students' Hospital) allows you to make up for any lost graded assignment or quiz, but won't remove the absence at all.**   
   
# Lectures   
   
The one who gives it is called a doctor or professor, duh, but the important part is we have a wide variety of them, there are some with nice lectures that you can either enjoy or just don't feel like time has forzen, while there is the opposite, and there is the in-between.   
   
First lecture is always the less strict one, you will know their rules, here are some of them that some of them enforce and the others don't:   
   
   
- No mobiles: some of them don't care, some of them will scold you if you use it or kick you out.   
   
   
- No drinks or food: actually it is kinda normal to eat in lectures due to having very short time between them and maybe no breaks at all, but some of them disallow it completely and may just allow you to drink WATER only.   
   
   
- No chatter with your friends: this is sort of a universal rule.   
   
   
- No going out from lecture: some of them disallow going out for any reason, though this is a bit rare, but a lot will just let you do whatever you want as long as you don't take long, you can go to the bathroom or get you something to drink/eat, but try not to take too long, and don't do that if the professor is strict, they might mark you as absent. With some of them you need to ask for permission to go out, and the others not necessarily. Better safe than sorry though.   
   
   
- Taking attendance: only a scant few don't take attendance, most of them take attendance and some of them take it at a random time, they might even take it when some people are out and won't accept any excuse you have, try not to go out before they do. Honestly though, most of them either take it after a fixed amount of time after the lecture starts, as soon as it starts, or at the end.   
   
   
- No taking pictures: some of them disallow taking a picture of the board, and female professors prefer that they aren't photographed in the picture.   
   
It is normal that you don't understand some professors at all, if the majority of the students don't understand then more likely than not you will understand in the tutorial, isA. Otherwise, you should seek help via looking for online material, asking the professor, or even ask the teaching assistant.   
   
# Tutorials   
   
The one that gives it is called a teaching assistant (TA), and normally they are more easygoing than the professor. They take attendance too though.   
   
# Assignments   
   
Mostly assigned by the professor, and you need to ask the professor who to submit it to, sometimes they tell you to submit it to the TA, sometimes you need to submit it to the professor himself. Always do it before the due date, rarely do they allow late submission without losing grades, if at all.   
   
# Projects   
   
A lot of courses include a project, sometimes it is 5-10% of your coursework grades, sometimes it is 20%. If it is 5-10%, then it is a minor project that is easy, hopefully, and maybe pairs or individuals. The rest are typically 4-member teams and the project typically takes a few weeks to finish. Projects need to be submitted **on time** because right after submission, in the next tutorial slot, most likely you will discuss it with the TA or the professor (varies from course to course).   
   
# Representatives `{_obsidian_pattern_tag_Support}`   
   
Those are students that volunteered to coordinate with the professors if the need arises, and notifies the students with any news the professor wants announced. They also handle changing any deadline or quiz date **if needed**, but do note that quiz date changes require an **unanimous** acceptance, if any students rejects it, then the proposal is automatically rejected.   
In freshman year, you will be typically divided into groups with a fixed timetable, hence each group should have a representative under the supervision of an older class. Typically, each group has its own WhatsApp group, plus a "General Newsfeed" group on which any important news that is relevant to the whole class is send, hence please never ever mute that one.   
After your freshman year, you should be sorted into, hopefully, your preferred program. Now each program should have its own WhatsApp group, and a new set of representatives. Some programs have multiple representatives, some have just one. The representatives get help from older representatives until they get used to it, so if you want to volunteer but don't know what exactly to do, don't worry. Just be prepared because it is similar to a management position: you need to be prepared for handling stuff frequently.   
When needing help, please reach out to your representative on the class **group** only, reaching in private is your last resort and used only when you need to share **private details**. Normally when you reach out to your representative in private, others do the same thing and in the end the representative is flooded with messages and takes a long time to reply to all, and **a lot of requests are actually repeated and others can reply to it, doesn't have to be the representative**.    
   
# Registration `{_obsidian_pattern_tag_Important}` `{_obsidian_pattern_tag_Registration}`   
   
Try to follow your program map as closely as possible, and try to be 5 minutes early. **Always check your timetable after registration.**   
If you are in waiting list, then there you will be accepted if you are in the first 10, otherwise either ask if the professor accepts everyone or you need to register another course instead. If the course you registered doesn't appear in your table, then the slot you tried to register was filled. You can use "Registration Status Report" icon to check the status of any available course.   
   
# Payment `{_obsidian_pattern_tag_Important}` `{_obsidian_pattern_tag_Registration}`    
   
To pay, you can use Fawry outlet on-campus near the Cafeteria, and it is the best option because you only pay 2 EGP as transfer fees, otherwise paying via Super Fawry service will incur higher fees.   
To calculate your fees, use this equation:   
(Credit hour price \* credit hours registered  + administration fees) \* 1.1 + any extra fees.   
The credit hour price and administration fees differ from class to class, so you need to ask your class/student affairs and note it down. Rarely does it differ for the same class through the years.   
You can ask the Credit Student Affairs for your total as well, normally they have this info available after the Drop only phase, which means the info is available from week 3 to week 5. Your payment code for Fawry is noted on your ID card and on your [Profile](#profile), it is 14 numbers long.   
   
# Withdrawal `{_obsidian_pattern_tag_Important}` `{_obsidian_pattern_tag_Registration}`   
   
You are allowed to withdraw from **only 2 courses per semster**.   
   
# Retaking a course `{_obsidian_pattern_tag_Important}` `{_obsidian_pattern_tag_Registration}`   
   
You are allowed to retake a course **5 times only in your whole academic study**. It is advised to do it only for courses where you got an F, or if you got a low score which when improved affects the cGPA greatly. Also, you can't retake a course after 2 main semsters have passed since you originally took it.   
**If you got a lower score, your old score will be replaced with the lower score. If you failed, then you will need to retake the course again.**   
   
# التماس/تظلم   
A request to re-calculate your final exam grades only. **No rechecking/regrading is done, it just re-calculates the given grade**. For a regrading, this requires a case to be presented to a legal court. To request one, check [Document Request](#document-request).   
   
# Industrial Training (IT) `{_obsidian_pattern_tag_IT}` `{_obsidian_pattern_tag_Important}`   
   
WIP   
   
# Militiary Training   
   
Mandatory for all male students.   
WIP   
   
# Evaluation `{_obsidian_pattern_tag_Important}`    
   
Mandatory and occurs in the last few weeks of the semster, if not done then you cannot access your account until the next semster, and won't be able to register your Spring courses in the first phase (in Fall semesters only).   
If you want to auto skip the evaluation, use [this script (**PC only**)](https://github.com/mostafa-abdelbrr/auto-skip-cufe-chs-staff-evaluation) which will mark all answers as "Can not answer" and finishes the whole evaluation, it is not actively maintained, so if it gets broken then either see if any of the other students makes a new one, otherwise fill it manually.   
In my opinion, the evalutation is completely useless, unless you have cosntructive comments to add.   
   
# Personal Account (Student Information System - SIS): `{_obsidian_pattern_tag_Important}`   
   
Your personal account is very important, and very helpful.

### Icons   
#### Registration   
* Register your courses (or group, freshman only).   
#### My Time Table   
* Check your current time table.   
#### Full Transcript   
* check all of your grades so far, and you can print it to pdf or to a printer.   
#### Profile   
* You can use it to check your program (after freshman year to check what program you got accepted into) and check your payment code.   
#### Graduation Report   
* Allows you to check the remaining courses you need to take with their credit hours, electives, and your grades in these courses.   
#### Advising Helper   
* Very useful for checking out your expectations for GPA since it allows you to select courses and set your expectance for their grade, then it shows you the calculated GPA and cGPA based on that.   
#### GPA Transcript   
* Similar to Full Transcript, just a different layout.   
#### Info And Warnings   
* Always opens by default when you open your account alongside "Update Personal Data". Tells you if you have any notice/alert for absence and if you were deprived of attending the final exam. In addition, it shows you any ultra important news.   
#### Mail System   
* Useless right now, similar to an internal email system.   
#### Term classwork   
* Shows your midterm and classwork grades. Always make sure it is correct, especially before the final exam since this data is used in calculating your final grade for the course.   
#### Registration Status Report   
* Shows status of any available course, whether it still accepts new registrants, its class size, count of students who are on the waiting list, remaining places (shown in negative), and its designated hall/lab.   
#### Request withdrawal from a course   
* Allows you to withdraw from any course, revise [Withdrawal Important Registration](#withdrawal-important-registration).   
#### Edit profile   
* Useless, I think, use [Update Personal Data](#update-personal-data) instead.   
#### In Class Attendance   
* I only used it once or twice throughout my academic study, maybe useless. The professor will tell you if you need to use it.   
#### Private Interent Password:   
* Useless, was supposed to give you limited access to the interent in Floor 7 of Architecture building.   
#### Document Request   
* Shows you a list of documents to choose from, and then asks you to pay for them and provides the needed link, which is [this one](http://ckes.cu.edu.eg/foe.aspx), never ever type it manually since you might go to another faculty's and your money will be wasted.   
* This icon is mainly used for إثبات قيد or .   
* You need to present the receipt to the Credit Student Affairs to get your requested document.
